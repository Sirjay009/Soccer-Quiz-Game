<h2>Features</h2>

<p>In achieving the user and app developer goals, i have created a two-paged picture/name pairing quiz game that requires players to identify a randomly generated player's image by name from five(5) provided name options while also using the feedback and scoring features to enhance users' experience. Upon visiting the app, users are greeted and invited to begin playing when they are ready via the welcome page. Upon clicking the start button, users are taken to the game page to begin playing.</p>
<br>

<h4>The Welcome Page</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is the first page visitors of the app encounter. The page welcomes players to the app and informs them what the game is about.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Start Button</h4>
<ul>
<li>A start button is provided on the welcome page that allows gives visitors access to the the game page to play the game.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Game Page</h4>
<ul>
<li>This page contains the game itself. Visitors/players can play the game directly on this page.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Feedback Feature</h4>
<ul>
<li>The feedback feature is otherwise identified also as the message feature. The idea behind including this feature is to notify players in real time of whether a selected answer is right or wrong.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Where a selected answer is right, a green-colored - "Congrats! Answer is Correct." - alert pops up and where the selected answer is wrong, a red-colored - "Incorrect! The answer was ${correctAnswer}" - pops up.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Scoring Feature</h4>
<ul>
<li>The idea behind including the scoring tracker feature is to keep track in real time of the number of players' won and lost plays. While the "correct" counter keeps track of number of correct answers scored by players, the "incorrect" counter tracks the number of players' wrong answers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>Solved bugs</p>

<li>Navbar items kept wrapping on tablet screens even after i reduced it's font size. I debuged it using the code - whitespace : nowrap; - on the media query of tablets</li>
